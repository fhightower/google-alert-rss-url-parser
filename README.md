# Google Alert RSS URL Parser

Using [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts), it is possible to collect interesting content that matches a specified search term into an RSS feed (or get an email about it).

This script is designed to parse the URL out of every entry in the RSS feed. The master branch contains a simple version of the script and other branches provide more specific functionality like the ability to create each URL found from an alert in [ThreatConnect](https://app.threatconnect.com).
